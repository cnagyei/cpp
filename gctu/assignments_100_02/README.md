### b.
- Identifiers - Identifiers are names that represent unique objects or class of objects. They are a type of string of alphanumeric characters that always begins with either an alphabetic or underscore character.

- Pseudocodes - A pseudocode is a notation, language-like solution resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design to create the outline or rough draft of a program. Pseudocodes summarize a program's flow, but excludes underlying details.
    - A pseudocode is not an actual programming language
    - A pseudocode cannot be compiled into an executable program
    - It uses short terms or simple English syntaxes to write code for programs before it is actuall converted into a specific programming language

    - Example of a pseudocode is shown below
    ```sh
    IF sum of two random dice numbers >= 18
        THEN print "You win!"
    ELSE print "You lose!"
    ```
